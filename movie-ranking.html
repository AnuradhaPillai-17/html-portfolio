<p>Well when you feel lost or demotivated i think its best to watch Shawshank Redemption can get a grip on you to believe, have faith on the outcome. </p>
<h3>Gone Girl</h3>
<p>Unexpected twists and turns and mind blowing thriller.</p>

<p>I love this movie since its light hearted, easy-going and feels beteer to watch. And yeah it's animated so it has a special place in my heart. </p>
